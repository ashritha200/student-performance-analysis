- student-mat.csv
- Source: Student Performance Dataset

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies
- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Jupyter Notebook

## 📊 Analysis Performed
- Average final grade (G3)
- Students scoring above 15
- Study time vs performance correlation
- Gender-wise performance comparison

## 📈 Visualizations
- Histogram of final grades
- Scatter plot (study time vs grades)
- Bar chart (male vs female average grades)

## ✅ Conclusion
The analysis shows a weak positive correlation between study time and grades. Male students performed slightly better on average.
